JOINS IN MYSQL 

Definition: A JOIN in MySQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them (usually Primary Key and Foreign Key).

Joins help retrieve related data stored in different tables.

1).INNER JOIN

Definition: Returns only matching rows from both tables.

Syntax: SELECT columns FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

Example: SELECT c.cust_id, c.cust_name, o.order_id FROM customers c INNER JOIN orders o ON c.cust_id = o.cust_id;

2) LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Definition: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for right table columns.

Syntax: SELECT columns FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

3) RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Definition: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for left table columns.

Syntax: SELECT columns FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

4) FULL OUTER JOIN

Definition: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

Note: MySQL does NOT directly support FULL OUTER JOIN.

Workaround: SELECT columns FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column

UNION

SELECT columns FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

5) CROSS JOIN

Definition: Returns Cartesian product of two tables. If table1 has 3 rows and table2 has 4 rows, result will have 12 rows.

Syntax: SELECT columns FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
