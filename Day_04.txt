DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE In MYSQL

Data Manipulation Language (DML) consists of SQL commands used to manage and manipulate data stored in database tables. These commands allow users to insert, retrieve, update, and delete records in a structured way.

DML commands are:

INSERT

Definition: The INSERT statement is used to add new records (rows) into a table.

Syntax: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);

Alternative Syntax (Insert multiple rows): INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2), (value3, value4);

Example: INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age, grade) VALUES (101, ‘Arun’, 20, ‘A’);

Explanation: The name of the table where data will be inserted. - column1, column2: The specific columns to store values. -
VALUES: Specifies the data to be inserted. - The order of values must match the column order.

SELECT

Definition: The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.

Syntax: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Select All Columns: SELECT * FROM table_name;

Example: SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE grade = ‘A’;

Explanation: - SELECT: Specifies the columns to retrieve. - FROM: Indicates the table source.  WHERE: Filters records based on conditions. * retrieves all columns.

Common Clauses Used with SELECT: 
WHERE - filter records 
ORDER BY - sort results 
GROUP BY - group rows 
HAVING -filter grouped data 
LIMIT - restrict number of rows

UPDATE

Definition: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

Syntax: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;

Example: UPDATE students SET grade = ‘A+’ WHERE student_id = 101;

Explanation: SET: Specifies columns to be updated. - WHERE: Defines which rows will be modified. - Without WHERE, all rows will be updated (use carefully).


DELETE

Definition: The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table.

Syntax: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Example: DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = 101;

Explanation: DELETE FROM: Specifies the table. WHERE: Determines which records to delete.  Without WHERE, all records in the table will be deleted.



TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE (TCL) IN MYSQL:

Transaction Control Language (TCL) consists of SQL commands used to manage transactions in a database. A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single logical unit of work.


TCL commands in MySQL:

START TRANSACTION / BEGIN

Definition: Used to begin a new transaction.

Syntax: START TRANSACTION;

OR

BEGIN;

Example: START TRANSACTION; 
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE account_id = 101; 
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE account_id = 102;

Explanation: Marks the beginning of a transaction block. Changes are not permanently saved until COMMIT is executed.

COMMIT

Definition: Used to permanently save all changes made during the current
transaction.

Syntax: COMMIT;

Example: COMMIT;

Explanation: - Saves all DML operations performed after START
TRANSACTION. - Once committed, changes cannot be undone using
ROLLBACK. - Ensures durability of the transaction.

ROLLBACK

Definition: Used to undo changes made during the current transaction.

Syntax: ROLLBACK;

Example: ROLLBACK;

Explanation: - Cancels all changes made after START TRANSACTION. Restores the database to its previous committed state.


SAVEPOINT

Definition: Creates a temporary point within a transaction to which you
can later roll back.

Syntax: SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

Example: START TRANSACTION; 
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE account_id = 101; 
SAVEPOINT sp1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE account_id = 102;
ROLLBACK TO sp1;

Explanation: - SAVEPOINT creates a marker inside a transaction. ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name reverts changes after that savepoint. 

RELEASE SAVEPOINT

Definition: Removes a savepoint from the current transaction.

Syntax: RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

Example: RELEASE SAVEPOINT sp1;

Explanation: Deletes the specified savepoint, Cannot rollback to that savepoint after it is released.

Example of Complete Transaction:

START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_name, amount) VALUES (1, ‘Rahul’,
5000);

UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 WHERE product_id = 10;

COMMIT;

Explanation: The transaction inserts a new order. - Updates inventory. - If both operations succeed, COMMIT saves changes.

Single Row Functions in MySQL

Definition: Single row functions (also called scalar functions) operate on one row at a time and return one result for each row processed. If a
table contains 10 rows, the function will return 10 results.

These functions are commonly used in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and HAVING clauses.

String Functions Used to manipulate character data.

	UPPER(column_name) Converts text to uppercase. 

	Example: SELECT UPPER(name) FROM employees;

	LOWER(column_name) Converts text to lowercase. 

	Example: SELECT LOWER(name) FROM employees;

	LENGTH(column_name) Returns the number of characters in a string.

	Example: SELECT LENGTH(name) FROM employees;

	CONCAT(str1, str2, …) Joins multiple strings together. 

	Example: SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ’ ’, last_name) FROM employees;

	SUBSTRING(string, position, length) Extracts a portion of a string.

	Example: SELECT SUBSTRING(name, 1, 3) FROM employees;

	TRIM(string) Removes leading and trailing spaces. 

	Example: SELECT TRIM(name) FROM employees;


Numeric Functions Used to perform mathematical calculations.

	ROUND(number, decimals) Rounds a number to specified decimal places.

	Example: SELECT ROUND(12.345, 2);

	ABS(number) Returns the absolute (positive) value. 

	Example: SELECT ABS(-10);

	MOD(number1, number2) Returns the remainder after division. 

	Example: SELECT MOD(10, 3);

	CEIL(number) Rounds up to the nearest integer.

	Example: SELECT CEIL(4.2);

	FLOOR(number) Rounds down to the nearest integer. 

	Example: SELECT FLOOR(4.8);

	Date Functions Used to manipulate date and time values.

	NOW() Returns current date and time. Example: SELECT NOW();

	CURDATE() Returns current date only. Example: SELECT CURDATE();

	DATEDIFF(date1, date2) Returns difference between two dates in days.

	Example: SELECT DATEDIFF(‘2026-02-10’,‘2026-02-01’);

	DATE_FORMAT(date, format) Formats date according to specified format.

	Example: SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), ‘%d-%m-%Y’);

Conversion Functions

	CAST(value AS datatype) Converts one datatype into another. 
	Example: SELECT CAST(‘123’ AS SIGNED);

	CONVERT(value, datatype) Converts value to a specified datatype.

	Example: SELECT CONVERT(‘2026-02-10’, DATE);
