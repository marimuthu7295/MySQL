Database Management System:
DBMS is a software that manages databases and allows users to access data using SQL Commands.

RDBMS – MySQL, PostgreSQL. Data Stored in tables.
DBMS – MongoDB. Data is stored in files.

Database:
A database is an organised collection of data.

SQL:
SQL – Structured Query Language
SQL is a language used to communicate with a database through a DBMS.

By using SQL commands, we can create databases and tables, insert, update, and delete data. We can also extract data from databases.

When we write SQL commands in MySQL (DBMS software) mysql server will read it, understand it and validate it and then finally execute the SQL commands we wrote.

A schema is a logical container that groups related tables inside a database to keep data organized.
