MySQL Operators Notes Based on table: 

customer_order_details Columns: cust_id, cust_name, cust_city, order_id, order_date, amount)

Arithmetic Operators Used to perform mathematical calculations.

-   Addition Example: SELECT amount + 100 FROM customer_order_details;

-   Subtraction Example: SELECT amount - 50 FROM customer_order_details;

-   Multiplication Example: SELECT amount * 2 FROM customer_order_details;

/ Division Example: SELECT amount / 2 FROM customer_order_details;

% Modulus (Remainder) Example: SELECT amount % 2 FROM customer_order_details;

2.Comparison (Relational) Operators Used to compare values.

= Equal to Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE cust_city = ‘madurai’;

!= or <> Not Equal to Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE cust_city <> ‘madurai’;

  Greater than Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE amount > 500;

< Less than Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE amount < 500;

  = Greater than or Equal to Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE amount >= 999;

<= Less than or Equal to Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE amount <= 499;

3) Logical Operators Used to combine multiple conditions.

AND Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE cust_city =‘madurai’ AND amount > 900;

OR Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE cust_city =‘madurai’ OR cust_city = ‘trichy’;

NOT Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE NOT cust_city =‘kvp’;

Special Operators

BETWEEN Used to select values within a range. 
Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE amount BETWEEN 500 AND 1000;

IN Used to match multiple values. 
Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE cust_city IN (‘madurai’,‘trichy’);

NOT IN Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE cust_city NOT IN (‘madurai’,‘trichy’);

LIKE Used for pattern matching. Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE cust_name LIKE ‘r%’;

IS NULL Checks for NULL values. Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE cust_name IS NULL;

IS NOT NULL Example: SELECT * FROM customer_order_details WHERE order_id IS NOT NULL;


Aggregate Functions in MySQL

Definition: Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single result.

They are commonly used with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

Main Aggregate Functions

1) COUNT() Returns the number of rows.

COUNT() Counts all rows including NULL values. 
Example: SELECT COUNT() FROM customer_order_details;

COUNT(column_name) Counts non-NULL values in a column. 

Example: SELECT COUNT(amount) FROM customer_order_details;

2) SUM() Returns the total sum of a numeric column.

Example: SELECT SUM(amount) FROM customer_order_details;

3) AVG() Returns the average value of a numeric column.

Example: SELECT AVG(amount) FROM customer_order_details;

4) MIN() Returns the minimum value in a column.

Example: SELECT MIN(amount) FROM customer_order_details;

5) MAX() Returns the maximum value in a column.

Example: SELECT MAX(amount) FROM customer_order_details;

Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY

GROUP BY groups rows that have the same values.

Example: SELECT cust_city, SUM(amount) FROM customer_order_details GROUP BY cust_city;

This returns total amount for each city.

Using HAVING Clause

HAVING is used to filter aggregated results.

Example: SELECT cust_city, SUM(amount) FROM customer_order_details GROUP BY cust_city HAVING SUM(amount) > 1000;
