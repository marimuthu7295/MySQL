Subquery in mysql:
Rules:
The column written after where in the outer query must be logically and technically compatible with what the inner query returns.
This compatibility has three mandatory dimensions:
1.	What kind and how many count  --  how many values are returned
2.	Data type -- what kind of values are returned
3.	Meaning --what those values represent

If anything mismatch it will throw error.
Universal Matching Table 

Outer Condition	Inner SELECT must return
=	1 column, 1 row
IN	1 column, many rows allowed
> <	1 numeric value
EXISTS	Any column (SELECT 1 is enough)

 (=) Operator
Subquery must return exactly one value ,data type must match and meaning must match
  in operator
Subquery returns multiple values in Only one column ,data type must match outer column
aggregate Functions (min,max,avg)
Will return single numeric value

Correlated subquery – inner query depend on outer query, and inner query doesn’t run independently.

Non correlated subquery – outer query doesn’t depend on inner query, and inner query run independently and its result is passed to the outer query.


  2. INDEX

Definition: An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval from a table. It works like an index in a book.

Uses:
Faster SELECT queries 
Improves search performance -
Reduces data scanning

Types of Index in MySQL:

1)  Primary Index

    Automatically created on PRIMARY KEY.
    Does not allow NULL values.

2)  Unique Index

    Ensures all values in a column are unique.

    Syntax: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX <index_name> ON table_name(column_name);

3)  Composite Index

    Created on multiple columns.

    Syntax: CREATE INDEX <index_name> ON table_name(column_name);

4)  Full-Text Index

    Used for searching text data.

    Syntax: CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX <index_name> ON table_name(column_name);

5)  Spatial Index

    Used for spatial data types.

    Create Index Syntax: CREATE INDEX <index_name> ON table_name(column_name);

Drop Index Syntax: DROP INDEX <index_name> ON <table_name>;


  3. VIEW

Definition: A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query. It does not store data physically.

Syntax to Create View: CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Example: CREATE VIEW high_salary_emp AS SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

Selecting from View: SELECT * FROM high_salary_emp;

Updating View: If the view is based on a single table without complex operations, it can be updated.

Drop View Syntax: DROP VIEW view_name;
